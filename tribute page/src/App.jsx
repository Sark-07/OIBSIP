              Heath Andrew Ledger (4 April 1979 â€“ 22 January 2008) was an
              Australian actor and music video director. After playing roles in
              several Australian television and film productions during the
              1990s, Ledger moved to the United States in 1998 to develop his
              film career further. His work consisted of twenty films, including
              10 Things I Hate About You (1999), The Patriot (2000), A Knight's
              Tale (2001), Monster's Ball (2001), Lords of Dogtown (2005),
              Brokeback Mountain (2005), Candy (2006), I'm Not There (2007), The
              Dark Knight (2008), and The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus
              (2009), the latter two being posthumous releases. He also produced
              and directed music videos and aspired to be a film director.
            </p>
            <p style={{ marginTop: "0.25em" }}>
              Ledger died in January 2008 as a result of an accidental overdose
              of medications. A few months before his death, Ledger had finished
              filming his role as the Joker in The Dark Knight, with his
              performance earning him universal acclaim and popularity.
